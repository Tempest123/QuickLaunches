 A GUI program to open multiple files or programs with a click of a button. The files or programs to be run can be changed via a GUI.

This is a very simple application which can be used to run multiple files. There are two buttons, one to add a file to executed and an other to execute the file.
Adding the file to be executed, stores the file loaction in a file named "save.txt" (upon successful exit of the app).
When the application is opened, it automatically opens the previously opend files. To remove this, you need to manually delete the entry present in save.txt file.
